Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 Iâ€™m Amenda Bernadeth Perera, and welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This repository showcases a series of data analytics projects executed using AWS services, focusing on five key areas: Exploratory Data Analysis, Descriptive Analysis, Diagnostic Analysis, Data Wrangling, and Data Quality Control. Each analysis is meticulously documented across dedicated branches, highlighting project descriptions, objectives, methodologies, tools, and deliverables. These projects reflect my expertise in using cloud-based tools of Amazon Web Services to extract insights, ensure data quality, and optimize decision-making processes. Please feel free to move beween the branches and explore my work and I hope it provides valuable insights for you!
